   sex work
      Termed by Scarlot Harlot, Sex Work is exchanging one's sexuality for money, goods, services, etc. Sex work includes prostitution, but it also includes a bunch of other things like erotic dancing, pro-dom/pro-sub work, web-camming, sensual massage, adult film, phone sex,  being a sugar baby, etc. 

   screening
      Mostly done by indoor workers, to verify the client is "safe", every worker has their own definition of safe, but generally the goal is to weed out physically harmful people, and perhaps police, if the work is illegal in their area.
