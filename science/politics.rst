Politics

.. #TODO clean this up, make it less opinionated.

The politics around sex work is a complicated one. Let's talk about it 
through history. When the USA was first getting going, sex work was 
totally legal, and still is federally. The only federal laws around 
sex work are that the military can decide if it's allowed near their 
bases of operation or not, and even then, they can only do that around 
prostitution, not other forms of sex work.

Prostitution only became illegal in many states along with prohibition 
of alcohol in the 1930's, which got repealed, but sadly prositituon laws 
didn't get repealed at the same time.

More recently there are two big groups around prostitution, one is the human 
trafficking contingent, and the other is the pro sex work contingent.  The 
pro sex work contingent in general has many lawyers and many health professionals 
on our side.  The human trafficking contingent is divided between coerced sex work 
is wrong(duh!) and the other side thinking everyone in sex work is coerced.

This is an important distinction, I think any sane, rational person can 
clearly agree that any coerced work (sex work or otherwise) is awful,
and definitely needs to stop. But that is very different than saying 
everyong doing job X is coerced and forced into doing that job.

Imagine if people thought all politicians were forced into that profession!
It would be ridiculous!
