The Science of Sex Work
=======================
.. TODO: cleanup, organize add more.

This is where we will put all the facts, statistics and research that has been done around sex work.

How many prostitues are there:
------------------------------

It is difficult to estimate the number of persons who currently work, or have ever worked as prostitutes for many reasons including the various definitions of prostitution. National arrest figures range over 100,000. The National Task Force on Prostitution suggests that over one million people in the US have worked as prostitutes in the United States, or about 1% of American women. [1]_

According to a study of New York adolescents in the sex trade, nearly half of adolescents are male or transgender. Only 8% were coerced into entering the sex industry. [2]_

Cost of arresting prostutes:
----------------------------

From a report in the 1980s, average arrest, court and incarceration costs amount to nearly $ 2,000.00 per arrest. Cities spend an average of 7.5 million dollars on prostitution control every year, ranging from 1 million dollars (Memphis) to 23 million dollars (New York). [3]_

Should Prostitution be legal?
-----------------------------

All the current contributors resoundingly say YES, but procon.org has a fairly large site dedicated to the topic [4]_
