Contributions
==============

All changes to SexWork.us_ is made through github.com, which is a site that
allows everyone to change and edit content, while keeping attribution and history.
Just click on the 'Edit on GitHub' link in the top right corner.

All of our site is written in reStructuredText_, a text based format
that should be very easy to read and write. There is a primer_, a
`user reference`_ and a `Cheat Sheet`_ available.

We welcome contributions! All contributions are done through our Github_ page.
You can edit directly from the website by creating an account(or logging in),
selecting a file, and then clicking the 'edit' button (looks like a pencil).
Github_ also keeps our entire history of the project and who made changes, when.
It's very handy!  If you don't feel like editing the content directly, you can
make suggestions, complaints, praise, etc. by filing an Issue_.
