Welcome to SexWork.us!
======================

`SexWork.us`_ is aiming to be a reference guide all about sex work.
 everything you want to know about sex work should be here, but we are
 still pretty new, so if there is something you want to see right away,
 you can file an `issue`_ with us on `github`_ and allows anyone to make/request changes!
 This reference guide is made for both sex workers and the general public.
