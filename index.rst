Welcome to SexWork.us!
=======================

`SexWork.us`_ is aiming to be a reference guide all about :term:`sex work`.

Wait, what is Sex Work? Well, when you get down to it, it's just a form of work
involving sex, or more specifically, sexuality (see a definition of :term:`sex
work`).  But if it's just another job, do we really need an entire website
devoted to it?  Well, ideally, definitely not! Unfortunately in many cultures
and countries, sex work is treated as less than a job, many aspects of the work
are illegal, etc.

We have one more reason this site exists, to quote Martin Luther King, Jr.

    In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps:
    collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist;
    negotiation; self-purification; and direct action. [MLK1]_

This site aims to be an easy to use, reference of the first step of collecting
facts and showing the injustice done to sex workers, while also
being directly useful to everyday concerns of sex workers around privacy,
safety, etc.

So now we know why this site exists, it's to cover all those pesky details
because, unfortunately, it's not treated like just another job, even if it
should be.
