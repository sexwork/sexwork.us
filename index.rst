Welcome to SexWork.us!
======================

`SexWork.us`_ is aiming to be a reference guide all about `sex work`_.

Wait, what is Sex Work? Well, when you get down to it, it's just a form of work
involving sex, or more specifically, sexuality (see a definition of `sex work`_).
But if it's just another job, do we really need an entire website devoted to it?
Well, ideally, definitely not! Unfortunately in many cultures and countries, sex work
is treated as less than a job, many aspects of the work are illegal, etc.

So now we know why this site exists, it's to cover all those pesky details because,
unfortunately, it's not treated like just another job, even if it should be.
