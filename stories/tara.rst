I started when I was 16 years old.  I met a man in his mid 30's (let's call him
Tito) who I would hang out with a lot, we would geek out about computers
together.  He was married with two young kids, and had a fetish for spanking.
I had a fetish for food, since there wasn't a lot of that at home. When I
learned he was into spanking but his wife was not, I said well I don't mind
being spanked.. and we came to an arrangement where he would spank me and
masturbate, and then I would get black velvet whiskey in exchange.  I wasn't
much of a drinker, but I was in High School, so it was easy to trade it out for
money or sometimes more directly food, which was mostly what I was interested
in.  It worked out well for me.  Looking back, it was clearly illegal, and
clearly I would never recommend anyone doing what I did. I was pretty mature
for 16, and even today I feel like overall it was a positive decision on my
part. I would definitely  do it again, despite the age difference.  I have no
clue where Tito is nowadays, he moved away a few months after we started, so it
didn't last very long.  Much later in life I would go back to doing some sex
work.
