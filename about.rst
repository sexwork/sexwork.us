About sexwork.us
================

This web site aims to be a reference guide about sex work, a one-stop shop 
for everything you want to know about sex work. Both for sex workers
(which most of the contributors are) and for the normal public. We are currently
mostly focused on sex work in the USA, because that is where the current contributors
are from, but we welcome contributions to add other regional/country specific perspectives.
We also welcome translations to other languages, please contact us via github for help getting started.

Contributions
--------------

We welcome contributions! All contributions are done through our Github_ page.
You can edit directly from the website by creating an account(or logging in),
selecting a file, and then clicking the 'edit' button (looks like a pencil).
Github_ also keeps our entire history of the project and who made changes, when.
It's very handy!  If you don't feel like editing the content directly, you can
make suggestions, complaints, praise, etc. by filing an Issue_.
