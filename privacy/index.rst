Privacy/Safety
==============

Services/Boundaries.
--------------------
Be clear about your boundaries and what services you are willing to provide. Once you make
up your mind keep firm in those choices throughout a client's visit. We strongly recommend
not changing your services during a session with a client.

Photos/media
------------
If you post/give away pictures/media of yourself, decide if you want to show your face or any distinguishing marks (tattoos/etc).
Once those things get out attached to a sex worker advertisement, it's very very hard(read impossible) to rein them back in.
This may not be a concern for you, or you may be an outdoor worker, where photos/etc are pointless.

Advertising
-----------

Some sex worker advertisements have lots of special language.
`rubmaps <http://www.rubmaps.com/rubmaps-slang>`_ keeps a very big list.
In general, we recommend not using special language. In general you want a particular sort of client,
figure out what sort of client you want, figure out what their interests are, stude those interests and then write
advertising language specific for that type of person.  If you are wanting Doctors and other professionals as clients,
look in the magazines/websites built for doctors and try to use the same type of language.
Overall we recommend trying to appeal to their emotional side, and not their Horny/Sexual side.

In general, the cleaner/neater and more professional you can appear, the more your clients will be cleaner/neat and professional. 

Online advertising can be done on lots of different websites or social media, a web search will likely find many more than I could list here.

In general ads need to get across 3 things:
  * What services you offer.
  * Why they want your services.
  * How to engage your services.

Screening
---------

Many sex workers, especially indoor workers `screen`_. This is something every worker needs to
work out for themselves, what sorts of things are you trying to check for?

Depending on what you are trying to check for, it can be either easy or hard to screen.

There are generally 5 methods sex workers use to screen:

* Gut Check
  Where you just talk to them for a minute or two and see if your "creep meter" goes off.
* References to other sex workers they have seen.
   This is a great way to meet other sex workers, and to maybe build a local support group or `SWOP`_ chapter!
* Job reference/etc.
  This is where you verify their work/employment or some other "real world" information.
* Social Media
  Checking their social media presence, (FB/twitter/linkedin/etc).
* Public in-person meeting before work appointment.
  Meet them in a public place (coffee shop/mall/etc) before scheduling an appointment to actually perform services.

Some sex workers do 1 or all of the above, and some do none of the above, and some do other things not spoken of here.
Regardless of your choices here, be consistent with your clients, follow through with the checks, and actually verify the things given.
Doing all of these things still won't gaurantee safety, there is always risk with every job, and sex workers have to decide their risk-level and comfort.
