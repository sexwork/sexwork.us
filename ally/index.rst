Being an ally/partner to a sex worker
=============================

Being an ally is hard work, but it's good, important work.

Here are some general tips on being a good ally. Feel free to replace 'sex worker' below with any other oppressed group.

Recognize oppression.
--------------------

Recognize oppression when it happens, this means keeping a close eye out, and
then saying something when you see it.

Be loud and proud.
-----------------

Be loud and proud, so sex workers in the closet for safety reasons can stay there.
This goes with the previous point as well.

Do not promote patience.
-----------------------

I give you a quote from `Martin Luther King, Jr.`_ as to why:
   We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given
   by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet
   to engage in a direct-action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of
   those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For 
   years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro 
   with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant "Never." 
   We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that 
   "justice too long delayed is justice denied." [MLK1]_


This is just scratching the surface of being a good ally.

If you are an ally and think a sex worker is being unsafe, or doing something stupid, try coming from a place of `harm reduction`_ first.
