Being an ally/partner to a sex worker
=============================

Being an ally is hard work, but it's good, important work.

Here are some tips on being a good ally. Feel free to replace 'sex worker' below with any other oppressed group.

* Be loud and proud, so sex workers in the closet for safety reasons can stay there.
* Do not promote patience, I give you a quote from `Martin Luther King, Jr.`_:
    “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was "well timed" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word "Wait!" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This "Wait" has almost always meant "Never." We must come to see . . . that "justice too long delayed is justice denied.”
* Recognize oppression when it happens, the means keeping a close eye out, and then saying something when you see it.

If you are an ally and think a sex worker is being unsafe, or doing something stupid, try coming from a place of `harm reduction`_ first.
