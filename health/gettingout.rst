Transitioning Out of Sex Work
==============================

Sex Work is not for everyone, and everyone has various reasons for starting
or stopping sex work. Whenever you do get out of sex work, you may need support.
This page is here to help guide those getting out on the best ways to get that
needed support, if it's emotional, educational, financial or logistical.

Melissa Petro wrote an interesting article about `Life After Sex Work <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/17/life-after-sex-work.html>`_
Also Furry Girl wrote a series about `Transitioning out of Sex Work <http://www.feminisnt.com/topics/transitioning-out-of-sex-work/>`_

Both are worth reading.
